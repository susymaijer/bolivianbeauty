<p><u><i>Tinamus</i></u> chick, but which species?</p>

<p><a href="TinamusChick1.jpg"><img src="TinamusChick1Small.jpg" width="152" height="96"></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;
<a href="TinamusChick2.jpg"><img src="TinamusChick2Small.jpg" width="152" height="117"></a></p>

<p>This is a chick of a <i>Tinamus</i> species according to Jon Fjelds&aring; (&quot;Palaeognathous birds (= ostriches, rheas, tinamous etc) can
immediately be recognized by the position of the gape, as the roof of the upper mandible is continuous with the palate of the skull, 
while in all other birds there is an angle between the plane of bill and skull").</p>

<p>It walked into a net set up by Stefan Woltmann (<a href="mailto:harpagus@yahoo.com">harpagus@yahoo.com</a>) at 14.40S,62.05W in
central Santa Cruz, Bolivia.</p>

<p>Can anyone say what <i>Tinamus</i> species this is?</p>

<p><u>Were all these sounds made by <b>Spot-winged Antbird</b> <i>Percnostola leucostigma</i>?</u></p>

<p>The following four recordings were all made by &copy; Omar Rocha O. along the Rio Madre de Dios in the depto of Pando, in 1991.
But, although I have little doubt that the first recording is of the Antbird (it is very similar to a recording of that species
by the late Ted Parker, also made in Pando, and archived at Cornell LNS under #38882), the other recordings sound rather different.
All recordings are in MP3 format.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="SM2646_a22.mp3">Two birds countersinging</a> at Chive (11.31S,67.42W).
<li>These <a href="SM2647_b05.mp3">alarm calls</a> and <a href="SM2647_b05b.mp3">songs</a> were recorded from the same bird,
also at Chive. I think the calls indicate that this was indeed an Antbird, but I am puzzled by why the songs sound so different
from those on the first recording.
<li><a href="SM2649_b04.mp3">A singing bird</a> at Remanso (10.56S,66.18W). Four stretches, all recorded within probably less than 
fifteen minutes. Or was this a Long-billed Gnatwren <i>Ramphocaenus melanurus</i>?
</ol>
<p>Note that these birds sing different from those in the foothills, but that's another matter.</p>
<p>Curtis Marantz (<a href="mailto:AlineandCurtis@aol.com">AlineandCurtis@aol.com</a>) wrote on 17 January 2002: "Both #1 and #2 sound 
to me like <i>Schistocichla (Percnostola) leucostigma</i>; the songs and the calls both sound good for this species. I suspect that 
the songs in part 2 were given in response to tape playback, so the bird is somewhat agitated. I also agree with you that the songs 
in part #3 sound like those of <i>Ramphocaenus melanurus</i>."<br>
I followed Curtis' advice for the arrangement of the recordings on the next version of the Bolivia DVD-ROM.</p>

<p><u>Unidentified Blackbird</u></p>

<p><a href="IcteridBennett.mp3">Recording</a> by Bennett Hennessey. Bennett's notes: "Song, one natural, one playback. 
All black icterid was seen. Vocal notes say 'Grackle like jizz'. ..&quot;. The other bird is a Masked Trogon.</p>

<p>I bet this is a (black-billed variant of?) Subtropical Cacique <i>Cacicus uropygialis</i>. Just note the striking similarity to
some of the phrases on Example 3 on John Moore and Mitch Lysinger's "The birds of Caba&ntilde;as San Isidro, Ecuador" double-cassette.
This species would be a new bird for the country to my knowledge. Wow!</p>

<p>Recorded at 2400 m in the Bolivian mountains, close to the border with Peru.</p>
