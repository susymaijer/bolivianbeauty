<ul>
    <li>16 November 2002:<br>
        - removed the photos of the questionable Brownish Flycatcher <i>Cnipodectes subbrunneus</i>, after Daniel Lane 
          found the "solution" of Thrush-like Schiffornis <i>Schiffornis turdinus</i>
    <li>15 November 2002:<br>
        - removed a mystery photo, after Daniel Lane found the solution (Ringed Antpipit <i>Corythopis torquata</i>)
    <li>13 November 2002:<br>
        - removed the photo of the strange Thrush-with-the-eyering, even though it isn't really "solved",<br>
        - removed the photo of the probable Short-crested Flycatcher <i>Myiarchus ferox</i>,<br>
        - removed the photo of the (probable) young, female (or both) White-flanked Antwren.
    <li>9 November 2002:<br>
        - removed the Stripe-headed Antpitta songs again, because Gunnar Engblom saw it make <u> both</u> vocalizations.
    <li>8 November 2002:<br>
        - added the two "alternative" Stripe-headed Antpitta songs.<br>
        - added the <i>Tinamus</i> chick.<br>
        - added the <i>Cnipodectes</i> / <i>Sapayoa</i> phots.</li>
    <li>18 September 2002:<br>
        - added the Swainson's Flycatcher photograph, taken by Jon Hornbuckle.</li>
    <li>5 September 2002:<br>
        - added the two mystery photographs by Omar Rocha, taken in Pando, Bolivia.</li>
    <li>15 August 2002:<br>
        - removed the <i>Xenoglaux?</i> recordings, because a 2002 LSU expedition taped the real -and entirely
      different- song of the species.<br>
        - a mystery female Black-Tyrant <i>Knipolegus</i>  sp. on photos by Susan Davis was identified by Mark Pearman as
          a White-winged Black-Tyrant <i>Knipolegus aterrimus</i>.</li>
    <li>5 March 2002:<br>
        - added the unidentified montane Blackbird recording by Bennett Hennessey.</li>
    <li>5 March 2002:<br>
        - the <i>Myrmotherula</i> Antwren photo is of a young male White-flanked Antwren <i>M. axillaris</i>.</li>
    <li>1 and 5 March 2002:<br>
        - A mystery <i>Contopus</i> Flycatcher recording by Bennett Hennessey was quickly &quot;solved&quot; by various
      people (as Western Wood-Pewee <i>C. sordidulus</i>).</li>
    <li>19 January 2002:<br>
        - added Curtis Marantz' comments about the mystery Thrush.</li>
    <li>17 January 2002:<br>
        - added the Spot-winged Antbird <i>Percnostola leucostigma</i> (?) recordings.</li>
    <li>15 January 2002:<br>
        - removed the "Antbird?", which was identified by Daniel Lane as a first-year male Plain-winged Antshrike
        <i>Thamnophilus schistaceus</i> ("red eye, heavy bill, lack of any markings on wings, etc.").<br>
        - removed the "Lesser Shrike-Tyrant or Fuscous Flycatcher?", which was identified by Daniel Lane as
          Large-headed Flatbill <i>Ramphotrigon megacephala</i> ("pale base to mandible, whitish spectacles, 
          streaked throat, wingbars and pale edges, etc.")<br>
        - removed the <i>Glaucidium</i> Pygmy-Owl. This should be Bolivian Pygmy-Owl <i>Glaucidium bolivianum</i>, by range.<br>
        - replaced the single short recording of (probably) Whiskered Owlet by two much longer ones in MP3 format.</li>
