<p><u>Not songs of <b>Whiskered Owlet</b> <i>Xenoglaux loweryi</i></u> </p>

<p>Two recordings by &copy; Jon Hornbuckle, of unseen nocturnal birds or animals, heard and recorded on several nights in forest at
altitudes of 1800 to 2200 meters, at Abra Patricia, San Mart&iacute;n, Peru, in November 1998.</p>

<p>A Louisiana State University ornithological expedition to the Abra Patricia area tape recorded the song of <i>Xenoglaux</i>, 
and it is very different from these songs (click <a href="http://www.museum.lsu.edu/lane/DFLresearch1.html">here</a> to hear
it on Daniel Lane's website). Daniel Lane (who
made the confirmed recording) wrote about Jon Hornbuckle's recordings: &quot;The voice does sound immensely like an Amazonian bamboo rat
(<i>Dactylomys</i> sp.), and given the prevelence of <i>Chusquea</i> at the sites, I can believe that there may be a congener here (and
given that it seems no one has ever tried to trap small mammals here, the fact that this would be an undescribed species of rat is not hard to believe)&quot;

<p><u>Young male <b>White-flanked Antwren</b> <i>Myrmotherula axillaris</i></u></p>

<p>For a long time, I hesitated between Gray Antwren <i>Myrmotherula menetriesii</i>  and 
White-flanked Antwren <i>M. axillaris</i>. But several people with much more experience than me (with Daniel Lane giving
the last push) told me it is a White-flanked Antwren.</p>

<p><u>Probably a young and/or female <b>White-flanked Antwren</b> <i>Myrmotherula axillaris</i></u></p>

<p>Both Stefan Woltmann and Daniel Lane think this is probably White-flanked Antwren <i>Myrmotherula axillaris</i>.</p>

<p><u>Both these sounds are made by <b>Stripe-headed Antpitta</b> <i>Grallaria andicola</i></u>!</p>

<p><a href="Grallaria_andicola_Antbirds_CDs.mp3">This recording</a> on the new "Songs of the Antbirds" CDs, but also the long ascending series
on <a href="Grallaria_andicola_Niels.mp3">this recording</a></p>

<p>The first recording was made by Tony Meyer at "Pe&ntilde;as Canyon" in Cuzco. The second recording was made by Niels Krabbe at 4100 m
in the Cordillera Blanca, Ancash. Note that the song on the first recording is also present on the second.</p>

<p>Phyllis and Mort Isler in a message on 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Birdingperu/">the Birding Peru forum</a>
about these two recordings: &quot;.. it is interesting that taxa in the <i>Grallaria rufula</i> complex have two vocalizations, one a "song" (?) 
which is on the Antbirds CD and the other a rattle type vocalization which we assumed was a call.&nbsp;These two vocalizations
may be homologous to those of <i>G. andicola</i>." </p>

<p><u><b>Ringed Antpipit</b> <i>Corythopis torquata</i></u></p>

<p><a href="MysteryBirdOmar2.jpg"><img src="MysteryBirdOmar2_small.jpg" width="200" height="134"></a></p>

<p>Photo taken by Omar Rocha and Kent Smith along the Rio Madre de Dios, Pando, Bolivia, in 1991.</p>

<p>Solved by Daniel Lane: "(..) it is a <i>Corythopis torquata</i> (Ringed Antpipit). The size is hard to judge, 
but it should be about right, the "olive back" and "contrasting gray head" is again the effect of lighting 
and computer transmission on the photo. The pale tan eye, white throat, pink mandible, and overall shape all agree 
with <i>Corythopis</i>. It is unfortunate that the bird's wing is obscuring the underparts in this photo".</p>

<p><u>Agitated calls of <b>Western Wood-Pewee</b> <i>Contopus sordidulus</i></u></p>

<p><a href="Contopus.mp3">Recording</a> by Bennett Hennessey  of an unidentified <i>Contopus</i> Flycatcher, made at 1800 m in the Bolivian Andes, near the border with Peru.</p>

<p>Paul Coopmans, Richard C. Hoyer, Daniel Lane, and Curtis Marantz all told me these are calls of Western Wood-Pewee <i>C. sordidulus</i>.</p>

<p>Bennett's recording notes:<br>
"09h15 09NOV01, 1800 m, Tokoaque research site, footpath to Moxos, Landslide clearing where bird is calling at edge of the 
forest. Singing ind. of pair was seen looking like <i>Contopus fumigatus</i> (calls of less volume could be of other ind.). 
After the recording, I broadcasted to the same ind. prerecorded song of <i>Contopus borealis</i>, 
<i>C. fumigatus</i> (Bolivian Andes), <i>C. virens</i>, <i>C. sordidulus</i> and <i>C. cinereus</i>- none of which sounded 
much like the recorded bird. There was no evident response to playback, neither an approach nor a change in behaviour pattern. 
I then did playback of this individual's song, which illicited a strong response to playback with a fast approach and a 
2-3 minute searching behaviour. Middle montane forest, Base camp at 2000, WCS, WWF and Instituto de Ecologia research site 
Tokoaque (S 14°37’05 W 68°57’06), PN Madidi, Dept. La Paz."</p>

<p><u>Probably <b>Short-crested Flycatcher</b> <i>Myiarchus ferox</i></u></p>

<p><a href="SwainsonsFlycatcher.jpg"><img src="SwainsonsFlycatcherSmall.jpg" width="300" height="201"></a> </p>

<p>Photo made by &copy; Jon Hornbuckle in the Beni Biological Station, in August 1995.</p>

<p>Daniel Lane argued that this is probably Short-crested Flycatcher <i>Myiarchus ferox</i>, and not Swainson's F. <i>M.
swainsoni</i> (but he isn't absolutely sure, as the colors on the photo may not be 100% accurate).</p>

<p><u>Almost certainly <b>Thrush-like Schiffornis</b> <i>Schiffornis turdinus</i></u></p>

<a href="Cnipodectes3.jpg"><img src="Cnipodectes3Small.jpg" width="165" height="114"></a>
</p>

<p>These photos were made by &copy; Stefan Woltmann at Cocoli in Panama (09.05N,79.79W).</p>

<p>They are put under Brownish Flycatcher on the &quot;Birds of Bolivia 2.0&quot; CD-ROM, but I put them on the "mysteries" web page after 
Mark Pearman expressed doubt about the identification. The
"solution" was finally found by Daniel Lane: almost certainly Thrush-like Schiffornis <i>Schiffornis turdinus</i> 
(&quot;I agree 
with Mark Pearman that this bird is not a <i>Cnipodectes</i>, but it is not <i> Sapayoa</i> either. My guess is <i> Schiffornis
turdinus</i>. It is 
unfortunate that all three photos show the bird from the same angle, as crown and bill shape are not really easy to see in any of 
them. However, the bird has a more brownish color overall (assuming the colors are not heavily distorted in
color), which does not agree with <i> Sapayoa</i> (which is entirely olive green), and more importantly, the flanks appear to be a 
paler grayish color, which fits <i> Schiffornis turdinus</i> and not <i> Sapayoa</i> (which has brighter yellow-olive belly if it is paler than the 
rest of the plumage). Of course bill shape would be the clincher (broad bill in <i>Sapayoa</i>), but as I said, one cannot really discern 
this from the photos. A male <i> Sapayoa</i> would be easy to identify by its yellow crown patch, but this is not present in females. 
The bird is not <i> Cnipodectes</i> as the eye color seems wrong (pale brown-gray rather than darker chestnut or red... the former does 
agree with <i>Schiffornis</i>, and the latter is standard for <i>Cnipodectes</i>), there are no pale edges visible on the tertials and the 
wing shape and general "cleanliness" of the bird is wrong (<i>Cnipodectes</i> never look like they've been having a good day, 
they're always ratty!), the tail is too short, there are no rictal bristles visible, and the (lower) mandible is not 
uniformly pale pink or orange&quot;).</p>

<p><u>Lawrence's Thrush <i>Turdus lawrencii</i></u></p>

<p><a href="Turdus1.jpg"><img src="Turdus1_small.jpg" width="112" height="108"></a> </p>

<p>&copy; Jon Hornbuckle. Beni Biological Station, 8 August 1996. Bird was caught in a degraded fragment of seasonally-inundated forest.
Appeared to be a first year bird, from its pointed tail feathers and buff-tipped secondary coverts.</p>
