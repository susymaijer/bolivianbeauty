<p>Hamburgo is the place for <b>Masked Antpitta</b> <i>Hylopezus auricularis</i> (click the small 
picture on the right to see a large photo, and there are recordings of song and calls
on <a href="http://www.birdsongs.com/Bolivia/snds_eng.htm">Some Bird Sounds from Bolivia</a>).</p>

In March 1994, I went birding with my friends Bernard Geling and Douglas Knapp to Riberalta. I don't really remember why 
exactly Riberalta, but I think it was because Bernard knew friends living there. Anyway, we ended up birding for two and 
a half weeks! I found it a fantastic place, not only because the birding was excellent, but most of all I think
because our rented motorbikes made birding very pleasant. No more long, hot and thirsty walks back to town after a long
morning of birding, but a fast ride with the cool wind through your hair! My enthusiasm was not even dampened by a rather
bloody fall on the rough gravel when a dog crossed the road at night in front of me!</p>
<p>Anyway, while birding alone one late afternoon just outside town in a low-lying area called Hamburgo, 
in the most heavily disturbed habitat imaginable, my attention was drawn by a loud song which was obviously made by an 
Antbird. It much resembled the song of Amazonian Antshrike, but the strange thing was that it didn't come in after
playback, whereas Amazonian Antshrike always flies in to come singing almost on top of your head!</p>
<p>That afternoon I didn't see the bird, even though it responded well to playback by coming close and singing even more
loudly. If I remember well, it was only two days later that I drove a bird to such utter desperation by endless 
playback (poor bird!, please don't do this again), that at last it came to sing on a branch only two meters over 
my head! What I saw was a "Spotted Antpitta with a black mask".</p>
<p>Some weeks later I wrote about this to the renowned Antbirds experts Mort and Phyllis Isler. They soon wrote me back
telling me that I had probably found the <i>auricularis</i> race of Spotted Antpitta. But they also asked me if I
was certain that the recording I sent them was really made by the Antpitta, so utterly different was the song from the
songs of the other races of Spotted Antpitta!</p>
<p>It turned out that the <i>auricularis</i> race is only known from this area. It was first collected by Alfonso M. 
Olalla in 1937 on the other side of the river (between the rivers Beni and Madre de Dios), less than 10 km away 
from Hamburgo,  and since then only J. V. Remsen had seen it at Tumichucua, less than 20 km sw of Riberalta (see 
<a href="#map">map</a>).</p>
<p>So that was all great news. A dream come true! A distinctive-looking race of an Antpitta with a completely
different song, very different habitat (muddy ground near the river, instead of high forest like the other races), and
a tiny (known) distribution. And an endemic for Bolivia to boot! So I got a little note published in the most
respected ornithological journal: The Auk! ("Rediscovery of <i>Hylopezus (macularius) auricularis</i>: Distinctive
Song and Habitat Indicate Species Rank", The Auk 115(4):1072-1073, 1998.)</p>
<p>Please read John Hornbuckle's and Barry Wright's trip reports about how they found the Masked Antpittas at Hamburgo (see 
list of trip reports on the <a href="..">front page</a>).</p>
Hamburgo, by the way, also has many other "good" birds: <b>Band-tailed Nighthawks</b> start flying around at dusk (in 
April at least), <b>Purus Jacamars</b> sit on the wires along the road, the <i>fuscicauda</i> race of 
<b>Blackish Antbird</b> (still
considered a race in the "official" books, but obviously a distinct species with its completely different song),
<b>Amazonian Tyrannulet</b> (formerly Pale-tipped T.), and <b>Lesser Kiskadee</b>.
<p>And see <a href="#Winkelmann">below</a> for the story of how Hamburgo got its name.

<p>When searching the web about what more I could find about
&quot;Hamburgo&quot;, I encountered the explanation of 
where the place got its name in the "Hamburger Abendblatt". Unfortunately they removed the page from their website,
but here is the translation:</p>

<p><font size=+1><b>"Bolivia: 1860 came a Mr. Winkelmann</b></font></p>
<p>Somewhere in the middle of nowhere, or more precisely: in the far north of Bolivia, is Puerto Hamburgo (...).</p>
<p>The last house of the former settlement Puerto Hamburgo in Bolivia: a little maize farm.<br>
That was until 1970, when the last inhabitants left, after the Rio Beni again inundated the whole place. It was then 110 
years ago that a German immigrant called Winkelmann settled in this godforsaken place at ten kilometers from the little
town of Riberalta, and founded a plantation. Why he called the place Hamburgo, nobody knows.<br>
The wide, brown Rio Beni is still crossed by a ferry, but the hand full of people still in Hamburgo now make a living
burning
tiles. The soil is clay because of the inundations by the Rio Beni, and that makes that the quality of tiles made
here is unsurpassed in Bolivia. They are the hallmark of the whole area.
