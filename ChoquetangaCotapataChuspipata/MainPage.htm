<p><b>Introduction</b></p>

<p>Within a 45 minute
drive from the city of La Paz, the birding sites described below
offer quick access and some excellent birds. Both sites are
located along the (paved!) highway to the Yungas, on the eastern
slopes of the Cordillera Real, one at 3650 - 4100m and the other
at 3000-3300m. Habitats at the higher site are soggy alpine
grassland and an extensive moss- and <i>Polylepis</i>-covered
boulder and scree slope. The habitat at the lower site is low,
wet montane forest and (mainly) disturbed habitats.</p>

<p>Being located high
on the eastern slopes of the mountain range, these sites have fog
and rain on most days, especially so in the rainy season (November-April).
During that time of the year, it is best to go only for the early
morning. The clouds come in quite early on most days (at nine o
''clock or so), and usually it starts raining soon after. I never
visited during the dry season, but it should be more comfortable
then.</p>

<p>I visited both
sites in December '92/January '93, together with Rolf de By. I
visited them again in November/December '93 and January '94, each
site three times. And again, both sites once, in December 1996
with Tom Gullick.</p>

<p><b>Access</b></p>

<p>The sites can
easily be reached by public transport, and it is usually no
problem to get a ride back. This is one of the busiest roads in
the country, because all the transport from the city of La Paz to
the Yungas and the eastern lowlands passes over this single road.
Most of the buses leave from Villa Fatima early in the morning.
Fast minibuses to Coroico leave at 08.30am and 09.00am, which is
a bit late. It may be best to buy tickets the day before. An
alternative is to go by taxi, which is not so expensive if there
are several of you. It should be possible to rent a taxi for the
morning for Bs 150 to 200. Of course, you have to negotiate a
little.</p>

<p>On the way back, I
rarely had to wait for more than 15 minutes, but you need some
luck of course.</p>

<p>After leaving the
city, the road winds up to the pass called &quot;Tres Cruces&quot;
(or &quot;La Cumbre&quot;, which simply means &quot;The Highest
Point&quot;), at about 4700m. </p>

<ul>
    <li><u>Side trip</u>:
        One or two kilometres before the pass, a small vehicle
        track leads to the right over low hills (there is a small
        road sign, but I don''t remember what it says). Behind
        the hills is an extensive cushion bog, at about 4650m.
        Birds found here are characteristic for this habitat:
        Andean Goose <i>Chloephaga melanoptera</i>, Speckled Teal
        <i>Anas flavirostris</i>, Crested Duck <i>Anas
        specularioides</i>, Puna Hawk <i>Buteo poecilochrous</i>,
        Aplomado Falcon <i>Falco femoralis</i>, South American
        Snipe <i>Gallinago paraguaiae</i>, White-fronted Ground-Tyrant
        <i>Muscisaxicola albifrons</i>, Andean Rufous-backed
        Negrito <i>Lessonia oreas</i>, Andean Swallow <i>Hirundo
        andecola</i>, White-winged Diuca-Finch <i>Diuca
        speculifera</i>, Bright-rumped Yellow-Finch <i>Sicalis
        uropygialis</i>.</li>
    <li><u>Side trip</u>:
        Just before the statue of Christ on the pass itself, a
        vehicle track leads up to the left, into barren terrain
        of black scree with little artificial lakes, at 4700m-5000m.
        During two visits I encountered Rufous-bellied Seed-Snipes
        <i>Attagis gayi</i> here, but only at dawn and dusk. </li>
</ul>

<p>Behind the pass,
the road winds down through the long valley of the Rio Unduavi.
If there are clouds in the valley, you need probably not bother
to continue, as it is almost certain that the sites described
below are already wrapped in fog and drizzle.</p>

<p>In the upper
reaches of the valley, you may find Short-tailed Finch <i>Idiopsar
brachyurus</i> on boulders along the road.</p>

<p><a name="ChoquetangaDescription"><b>Site 1: The Choquetanga Side Valley.</b></a>
(see <a href="Choquetanga.htm">photographs</a>)</p>

<p>Eventually, at km.
37, you reach a long line-up of food stalls on the right hand
side of the road. This is the place to get off the bus, or to
park your car. At the bottom of the valley, to your right, one
can see the tiny village of Pongo.</p>

<p><img src="Choquetanga%20valley.gif" width="559" height="930"></p>

<p><b>To the Second Step</b></p>

<p>Just before
reaching the food stalls, a little stream comes tumbling down
on the left. A trail climbs up the rocks just to the left of the stream,
up the first &quot;step&quot; of the little Choquetanga valley. It
requires some scrambling. The initial altitude here is 3650m.</p>

<p>Soon one reaches
more level ground. Here you must cross the stream. In case of
recent heavy rainfall, this crossing requires some jumping
ability to keep your feet dry (but what the heck, they''ll get
wet in the wet grass later anyway). From here you must head up
the slope to your right, until you reach a good trail. Between
the stream and the trail there is no obvious connecting trail,
only many small fields, most of them not currently in use. After
reaching the trail, it leads up to the left, crossing a boulder
slope to the top of the second &quot;step&quot;. </p>

<p>Before reaching the top of the second step, you may see the
following birds:<br>
- A little party of Paramo Pipits <i>Anthus bogotensis</i> was
always present at the start of the trail (where one can see the
food stalls below) in November and December 1993. One of them was
usually singing.<br>
- Scribble-tailed Canastero <i>Asthenes maculicauda </i>is common
in the tall bunch-grass.</p>

<p><b>The </b><b><i>Polylepis</i> slope</b>
(see <a href="Choquetanga.htm">photographs</a>)</p>

<p>Before reaching
the top of the second step, one enters the extensive boulder and
scree slope where the rarest birds mentioned in this article live.
Huge moss-covered boulders dominate some parts of the slope,
other parts have scree with no vegetation at all, and there are
all kinds of intermediate stages. The altitude of the slope
ranges from 3950 to 4100m. The best part of the slope is that
bordering on a level area after reaching the second step and
after walking around some low hills, keeping them to your right (it
is this area where the Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant was found, two out
of three times, both in 1993 and in 1996).</p>

<p>Numerous patches
of <i>Polylepis</i> shrubbery cover the slope, none bigger than
100 square meters. Each <i>Polylepis</i> patch has a thick,
spongy moss carpet beneath it, which also covers the &quot;trunks&quot;.
There are also many <i>Gynoxys</i> shrubs, which are far less
mossy than the <i>Polylepis</i>.</p>

<p>That <i>Polylepis</i>
still exists here at all must be because of all the slippery
boulders. Cattle, horses and llamas simply can not climb this
slope. However, the people living in Pongo make sure that no <i>Polylepis</i>
shrubs grow higher than about 2 meters, cutting everything higher
for firewood. Numerous fresh stubs can be seen all over the slope.
Nonetheless, some birds still manage to hang on (see Ref. 5).</p>

<p>Birds to be seen:</p>

<p>- Olivaceous
Thornbill <i>Chalcostigma olivaceum</i>. I only saw it once for
sure, in a corner of the rock face at the upper end of the
central section of the slope. I chased it from (or at least from
somewhere near), an empty cup nest in a crevice. Fjeldså and
Krabbe mention that <i>Polylepis-Gynoxys</i> woods may be its
breeding habitat (Ref. 4).</p>

<p>- Blue-mantled
Thornbill <i>Chalcostigma stanleyi</i>. I saw up to three during
each visit.</p>

<p>- Line-fronted
Canastero <i>Asthenes urubambensis</i>. I saw several during each
visit, clambering about on mossy boulders or in the shrubs.</p>

<p>- Stripe-headed
Antpitta <i>Grallaria andicola</i>. Rolf de By saw one on January
3 1992, on the central section of the slope, near the grassland
at the base, where there are big moss-covered boulders. The bird
moved around without being seen for most of the time, but several
times it popped up on a boulder to look around. This must be the
most easily visible <i>Grallaria</i> (if it really belongs to the
genus <i>Grallaria</i>). This species was since seen by several
other people.</p>

<p>- Ash-breasted Tit-Tyrant
<i>Anairetes alpinus</i>. I rediscovered this <i>Polylepis</i>
specialist on November 30 1993. While scrambling up the boulders
just after my arrival on the site, I heard some very vocal
birdies nearby. Imagine my surprise when I saw four birds of this
pretty species only a few meters away! I followed them for a long
time, while they moved noisily from one shrubby <i>Polylepis </i>patch
to another. I found them again on December 2, but not on January
1.</p>

<p>Two out of three
times, both in 1993 and in 1996, it was found in shrubbery close
to the level grassland beyond the second step, in an area with
big boulders, close to where the trail starts ascending the third
step. The third time I found it in a high corner of the slope,
where it borders on the rock face, and where there are still a
considerable number of relatively tall <i>Polylepis</i> bushes.</p>

<p>This species was
observed (and collected) in Bolivia only once before, by Carriker
in 1935, at 4100m above km 50 of the Yungas railroad (Ref. 2).
The railroad no longer exists, but it seems probable to me that
Carriker''s collecting site was the same as the here described
site , because 1: if he descended from the train at the village
of Pongo, then the Choquetanga side valley is the nearest and
most obvious side valley, and 2: the altitudes are the same. The
species is also known from several locations in the Peruvian
Andes (Ref. 2 and 4), where it is sufficiently rare to be
included in the ICBP Red Data Book (Ref. 2).</p>

<p>Some of the other
birds seen: Andean Condor <i>Vultur gryphus</i>, Andean Hillstar <i>Oreotrochilus
estella</i>, Great Sapphirewing<i> Pterophanes cyanoptera</i>,
Tawny Tit-Spinetail <i>Leptasthenura yanacensis</i>, Andean
Tapaculo <i>Scytalopus (magellanicus) simonsi</i>, Brown-backed
Chat-Tyrant <i>Ochthoeca fumicolor</i>, Cinereous (Plain-capped?)
Ground-Tyrant <i>Muscisaxicola cinerea (alpina?)</i>, Brown-bellied
Swallow <i>Notiochelidon murina</i>, Olive-backed Sierra-Finch <i>Phrygilus
punensis, </i>Plumbeous Sierra-Finch <i>Phrygilus unicolor</i>,
White-browed Conebill <i>Conirostrum ferrugineiventre</i>.</p>

<p><b>Suggestions for further exploration</b></p>

<p>Another bird to
find would be Royal Cinclodes <i>Cinclodes (excelsior) aricomae</i>.
Buckley collected it in 1876, somewhere in the next east-west
valley north of the Rio Unduavi valley (Ref. 2). It was never
found again in Bolivia. I searched for it in the Choquetanga
valley, but the <i>Polylepis</i> is possibly too low and patchy
for it. Still it may be here, as it is not always easy to find (Ref.
3). Later I searched with no luck in the impressive <i>Polylepis</i>
stands around Pelechuco (Cordillera de Apolobamba, near the
Peruvian border). Still, with the extensive Bolivian Cordilleras
hardly explored, I think it must still be somewhere.</p>

<p>It would be
interesting to climb up to the top of the ridge at the end of the
valley (there is a crashed helicopter on the way, also
interesting), and look down into the valleys on the other side,
or even climb down if possible. I think there must be comparable
sites with <i>Polylepis</i> in other nearby side valleys,
possibly only on slippery boulder slopes such as in the
Choquetanga valley, because I find it hard to believe that a
single family of Ash-Breasted Tit-Tyrant can persist in one
isolated location. Also, it was somewhere on the other side that
the Royal Cinclodes was found 120 years ago! </p>

<p><a name="CotapataDescription"><b>Site 2: Cotapata.</b></a>
(see <a href="Cotapata.htm">photographs</a>)</p>

<p>Some 15 km further
down the road to Coroico and Caranavi, one reaches the petrol
station of Cotapata. From here a narrow disused vehicle track leads down
the other (northern) side of the ridge to our birding site, into wet and disturbed montane shrubbery and forest.</p>

<p>The birding site
described here lies on the other side of the ridge from the main road (see map), so
there was no traffic noise in the 1990s when I was there. However, in 1996 a new road was being
constructed on top of the ridge to the east, which will
replace the Chuspipata stretch of the La Paz-Caranavi highway (which
starts 5 km beyond Cotapata at Chuspipata; a Miami Herald article
called that stretch &quot;The Most Dangerous Road in the World&quot;!).
The new road will not chase away the Diademed Tapaculos, I think
(they also occur along the present highway), nor many of the
other species, but it will certainly make for less tranquil
birding.</p>

<p>Behind the petrol
station, a track leads up and over the ridge (see one of the photos). After two
curves, at the foot of an electricity pylon, the track forks: take the track to the
right. It leads over
the ridge and zigzags down the other side.</p>

<p>In the ninth and last
hairpin, a soggy trail turns off to the left. It follows a long
disused, well-constructed road-like path, which in one place is
cut out of a nearly vertical rock face. Eventually, the trail
runs out in dense vegetation. (I wonder who built this road-like
path. I saw two similar paths near Pelechuco, both leading to
Apolo. According to the locals these Pelechuco-Apolo paths were
built by the Spanish, which means they are at least 200 years old!
Maybe they are precolumbian, who knows!)</p>

<p>Beyond the turn-off of the trail, the vehicle track turns into a narrow trail on a wide disused path, which
really is a continuation of the road-like path mentioned in the previous paragraph. I never followed it to the end, I only know that there
is a gold mining operation somewhere further down.</p>

<p>Birding is good
everywhere here, including along the track back to the petrol
station.</p>

<p><b>Birds to be seen:</b></p>

<p>- Sickle-winged
Guan <i>Chamaepetes goudotii.</i> First recorded in Bolivia by S.W.
Cardiff and J. V. Remsen at Cotapata, it is still only known to
occur here and in the nearby Zongo valley. I saw a single bird on
November 8 1993.</p>

<p>- Diademed
Tapaculo <i>Scytalopus schulenbergi</i>. This until then
undescribed species was discovered by Bret M. Whitney in 1992 at
Cotapata (Ref. 8). It is one of the commonest birds here, and its
songs are often heard. Playbacking its song lures it easily into
view; playbacking the alarm calls works even better. Making
'psssst' sounds works quite well too. It seems to be most common
in the ravines, but they are found all over the place.<br>
Adults can be
distinguished from neighbouring <i>Scytalopus</i> tapaculos by
the silvery-white, transverse crescent on the forecrown (the
&quot;diadem&quot;), which is most conspicuous when seen from a
frontal angle.<br>
The song is
distinctive: a fast evenly pitched series of about 10 seconds,
starting slowly with throaty syllables far enough apart to be
counted easily, after which it accelerates steadily for several
seconds. Like in the other <i>Scytalopus</i> tapaculos (at least
in Bolivia), songs are emitted at irregular and widely spaced
intervals, which makes it difficult to make good tape recordings.
They always seem to start singing behind your back!<br>
The most often heard
alarm call is a short series of about 10 notes, higher-pitched
than the song, a little rising at the start and descending at the
end, uttered at regular short intervals.</p>
